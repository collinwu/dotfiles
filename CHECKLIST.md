# Checklist

Dotfiles is one thing to clone and set up, but there are additional steps to gain parity with an old / existing development environment and workflow.

### Should do:

- [ ] Set licenses / keys to software (i.e. Alfred)
- [ ] Install [Alfred plugins/workflows](https://github.com/zenorocha/alfred-workflows)
- [ ] Run through `asdf` directory [README](asdf/README.md) and install plugins & versions
- [ ] Run through `docker` directory [README](docker/README.md) and leverage as much as possible
- [ ] Sync VS Code (IDE) [settings via Github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)

### Optional:

- [ ] Configure [cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)
- [ ] Configure any SSH remote connections
- [ ] Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for Python 3.x
