# Quality of Life Improvements

> Not everything can or may want to fit into the `brewfile`. However certain applications (usually paid) obtained outside of the App Store are great pieces of software.

## Considerations:

- Download [1Password browser extension(s)](https://support.1password.com/getting-started-browser/)

- Other browser extensions to consider [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp?hl=en-US)

- Cloud file sharing (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, etc)

  - Dropbox was removed from `Brewfile` as I think there are better options out there and also with `SHA` enforcement, Dropbox did not pass this.

- Mac Apps
  - [Alfred & Alfred Power Pack](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
    - **Note:** Could store and sync your Alfred preferences in a number of ways, Dropbox is supported by default.
  - [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)
  - [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/)
